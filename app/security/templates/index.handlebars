	<h3>2. Personal Safety</h3>
	<div class="padded-contents">
		<p>The following helps you think about your own personal situation and to take responsibilities for your safety in your surroundings.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Report incidents of suspicious packages, people or anything else security related to <a href="tel:+441865272944" title="Call University security" class="ss-standard ss-phone">University security</a></li>
			<li>If you are witnessing a crime taking place around the University call the <a href="tel:+441865289999" title="Call University security emergency" class="ss-standard ss-phone">University security emergency number</a> or call the Police on 112.</li>

			<li>Don't divulge your banking PIN numbers to anyone, even your friends.</li>
			<li>Please don't wedge doors open that are locked or require fob/swipe access.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Out and about</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Never carry large sums of money or passports with you unless you really need to.</li>
			<li>If you're wearing headphones, please wear only one as this will keep you alert to your surroundings.</li>
			<li>Always try to stay in a group if out at night.</li>
			<li>If you do walk home <em>don't</em> take shortcuts, stay where it is lit and where plenty of people or cars will be passing.</li>

		</ul>
		<h4>If you think you are being followed</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Walk with confidence, don't look at the ground. Most opportunist offenders will pick on someone that looks vulnerable and not someone who is confident.</li>
			<li>Keep looking behind you, so the person knows that you cannot be surprised.</li>
			<li>Cross the streete and/or change direction.</li>
			<li>If you are on the University estate call <a href="tel:+441865289999" title="Call University security emergency" class="ss-standard ss-phone">University security emergency number</a>.</li>

	<div class="padded-contents">
		<h4>Cycles</h4>
		<p>Unfortunately cycle crime does happen around the University estate, follow these simple tips to keep help your cycle safe.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Always use a D Lock which is "<a href="http://www.soldsecure.com/" title="Sold Secure's website" target="_blank" class="ss-standard ss-action">Sold Secure</a>". These locks have been tested and are sold as "Bronze", "Silver" and "Gold" which correspond to an attack resistance of 1, 3 or 5 minutes.</li>
			<li>When parking your bike remove any lights, use locking wheel nuts on your wheels and remove the saddle if portable.</li>
			<li>Always lock your bike to cycle hoops or in a secure cycle storage area.</li>
			<li>Don't buy an expensive bike just to ride to University.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Belongings in accomodation</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#register-items" title="Jump to the register items section">Register your belongings</a></li>
			<li>Don't leave laptops or mobile phones in view of open windows, it takes seconds to reach in from the street to grab something.</li>
			<li>Question people trying to get into a house or college hall if you don't recognise them, tailgating is a frequent event in Universities.</li>
			<li>If living in private accomodation, don't always assume that people are friends of friends - they could be opportunists waiting to get into a student house to take laptops, money, phones.</li>
			<li>Backup your work to an external drive that's kept separately to your computer so if the worst happens, at least you will have your work!</li>
